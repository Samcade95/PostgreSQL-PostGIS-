# PostgreSQL-PostGIS-
This is a project that utilized a large quantitative dataset featuring Farmer's Markets from all around the United States via The National Farmer's Market Directory from the US Department of Agriculture catalogs. 
The data was imported into a table and was cleaned for missing data and analyzed using the PostGIS extension within PostgreSQL and the pgAdmin4 relational database.
Spatial queries were also performed on the dataset's longitude and latitude values regarding the different Farmer's Markets.
